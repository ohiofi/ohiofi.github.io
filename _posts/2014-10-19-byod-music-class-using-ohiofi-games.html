<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4202" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/byod-300x224.jpg" alt="byod" width="300" height="224" />This photo shows a 4th grade student playing one of my Name That Note games. You can try these games too by visiting <a href="http://www.ohiofi.com/namethatnote/">www.ohiofi.com/namethatnote</a></p>
<p>These games are intentionally NOT based in Flash and therefore can be played on any internet connected device (iPhone, iPad, Android phone or tablet, laptop or desktop, Mac or PC). While a player will need to sign up for an OhioFi account in order to save their scores, it's also possible to play the games without signing up.</p>
<p>Recently I've mostly been working on Scratch games, which can be played here: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/20hz20khz/">http://scratch.mit.edu/users/20hz20khz/</a> Unfortunately, Scratch is Flash-based and cannot be played on an iOS device (iPhone or iPad). If you're interested in learning more about Scratch, I <del>will soon be posting</del>Â have posted <a title="Flipped Classroom Scratch Programming Lessons" href="http://www.ohiofi.com/blog/flipped-classroom-scratch-programming-lessons/">a series of Scratch Programming tutorial videos</a>.</p>
