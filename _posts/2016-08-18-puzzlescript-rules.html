<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/portal.gif" alt="portal" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6118" /></p>

<code>
<pre>[stationary zombie] -&gt; [randomDir zombie]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If enemy is next to target, then it moves away from target<br />
<code>
<pre>[enemy|target] -&gt; [< enemy|target]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If player is aligned with badGuy, then badGuy moves toward player<br />
<code>
<pre>[player|...|badGuy] -&gt; [player|...| < badGuy]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<h3>The Action Button</h3>
<p>If the action button (x) is pressed, then player is on top of seeds<br />

<code>
<pre>[action player| |enemy] -&gt; [action player| | ]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If the action button (x) is pressed and player is aligned with (one or more) enemy, then they disappear<br />
<code>
<pre>[action player|...|enemy] -&gt; [action player|...| ]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<h3>The Shape-Shifting Player</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wallbuilder1.gif" alt="wallbuilder1" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6112" /></p>
<p>If you put "player = man or boat" in the LEGEND section, you can have two or more sprites that represent the player. You can switch them like this:</p>
<p>If man is standing on top of dock next to water and moves toward the water, then man disappears and boat appears on water<br />
<code>
<pre>[&gt; man dock|water] -&gt; [dock|boat water]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If boat is next to dock and moves toward it, then boat disappears and man appears on dock<br />
<code>
<pre>[&gt; boat|dock] -&gt; [ |man dock]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<h3>Other Fun Stuff</h3>
<p>If boat is next to NOT water and moves toward it, then cancel the turn<br />
<code>
<pre>[&gt; boat|no water] -&gt; cancel</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If deadPlayer exists then restart the level from beginning or from last checkpoint<br />
<code>
<pre>[deadPlayer] -&gt; restart</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If player is on top of firstAidKit then firstAidKit disappears and a new checkpoint (restart location) is set<br />
<code>
<pre>[player firstAidKit] -&gt; [player] checkpoint</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Use "late" if the order of rules is important to you. In this example case, the player would sometimes step on the firstAidKit and then the game would wait until the next turn to remove it and set the checkpoint. Using "late" ensures that the player moves and then it checks this rule.</p>
<p>After all other rules have been checked... if player is on top of firstAidKit then firstAidKit disappears and a new checkpoint is set<br />
<code>
<pre>late [player firstAidKit] -&gt; [player] checkpoint</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Use "again" in order to make certain animations work. You will need to add an again_interval in the PRELUDE section (for example, again_interval 0.01).</p>
<p>After all other rules have been checked... if man is next to tornado then replace man with spinningMan1. Wait 0.01 seconds. spinningMan1 always becomes spinningMan2 and moves in a random direction. Wait 0.01 seconds. spinningMan2 always becomes spinningMan3 and moves in a random direction. Wait 0.01 seconds. spinningMan3 always becomes man and moves in a random direction.<br />
<code>
<pre>late [man|tornado] -&gt; [spinningMan1|tornado] again
[stationary spinningMan1] -&gt; [randomDir spinningMan2] again
[stationary spinningMan2] -&gt; [randomDir spinningMan3] again
[stationary spinningMan3] -&gt; [randomDir man]</pre>
<p></code></p>
<h3>Make Some Noise</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rotdp300w.gif" alt="rotdp300w" width="300" height="225" class="float-right size-full wp-image-6111" /></p>
<p>In the SOUNDS sections, use these:<br />
<code>
<pre>TitleScreen 5337906
ShowMessage 61224106
CloseMessage 1241234
Startlevel 22711100
EndLevel 88568102
Restart 123413
Undo 10987305
player Move 92275707
player CantMove 69279104
chair Move 41460507
badGuy Move 55946508
Sfx0 47352508
Sfx1 46769308</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>In the RULES section, you can use Sfx0 through Sfx9 like this:</p>
<p>If player steps on flower then flower disappears and play sound effect 0<br />
<code>
<pre>[ player flower ] -&gt; [player] Sfx0</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>If enemy is next to player then replace player with deadPlayer, put blood1 next to them, and play sound effect 1<br />
<code>
<pre>[enemy|player| ] -&gt; [enemy|deadPlayer|blood1] Sfx1</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Playing background music from YouTube USED to be supported, but no longer works. Here is the error message that you will get if you try: 
  <mark>"Unfortunately, YouTube support hasn't been working properly for a long time - it was always a hack and it hasn't gotten less hacky over time, so I can no longer pretend to support it."</mark></p>
<s><p>In the PRELUDE section, you can loop the music from a YouTube video as the soundtrack for your game. NOTE: This does not work in the Puzzlescript editor or on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Play the sound from this YouTube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2K_siojQNI<br />
