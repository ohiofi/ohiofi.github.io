<p><strong><a href="http://www.ohiofi.com/rookierecording/">Rookie Recording</a></strong> is a <a href="#">Twine game</a> that I created this summer. It's a video game about street cred, microphones, late night Taco Bell cravings, analog signal flow, unreadable brutal lettering, and an Electronic Talking Sir George Martin Super-Producer® action figure (still in it's original packaging).</p>
<p>If this year was 1986, you could say that <strong>"this video game has amazing, state-of-the-art graphics and animation."</strong></p>
