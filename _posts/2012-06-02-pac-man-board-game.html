<p>My aunt and uncle used to have this game. Sometimes when my sister and I would visit we would play it, but we didn't follow the rules at all. We would just dump out the marbles and play with the plastic Pac-man and ghosts.<a href="#"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1274" title="pacmanboardgame_effected" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pacmanboardgame_effected-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
