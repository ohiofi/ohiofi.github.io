<p>Because of poor acoustics, students in classrooms miss 50 percent of what their teachers say. Patients in hospitals have trouble sleeping because they continually feel stressed. Julian Treasure presents a call to action for designers to pay attention to the “invisible architecture” of sound.</p>
<p>Julian Treasure studies sound and advises businesses on how best to use it. He is the chair of the Sound Agency, a firm that advises worldwide businesses -- offices, retailers, hotels -- on how to use sound. He asks us to pay attention to the sounds that surround us... How do they make us feel: productive, stressed, energized, acquisitive? Treasure is the author of the book Sound Business and keeps a blog by the same name that ruminates on aural matters (and offers a nice day-by-day writeup of TEDGlobal 2009). In the early 1980s, Treasure was the drummer for the Fall-influenced band Transmitters.</p>
