The only problem is... it won't automatically republish whenever someone fills out the Google Form. Google was kind enough to place a checkbox for this feature, but only manual updates to the Google Spreadsheet will automatically republish. Unfortunately it currently doesn't republish if your spreadsheet is being updated via Google Forms.</p>
<p>How can we fix this? We are going to create a script that will automatically make a small manual update to the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>First of all, click the <strong>File</strong> menu, then <strong>Publish to the web...</strong>, and make sure that you have a check next to <strong>Automatically republish when changes are made</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, click the <strong>Tools</strong> menu and then <strong>Script editor...</strong></p>

You may get a pop-up wizard that says "Google Apps Script" and has links to tutorials. You can just close this.</p>
<p>Add the following code:<br />
<code>
<pre>function ChangeIt() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var t = new Date();
  var x = 'upd: ' + t;
  var range = sheet.getRange('f1');
  range.setValue(x);
}</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Where I have <strong>sheet.getRange('f1')</strong>, you may need to change <strong>f1</strong> to the name of some other empty cell.</p>
<p>Save your script and name it something like <strong>autorepublish</strong> or <strong>republishme</strong>.</p>

Click on the little clock icon.</p>
<p>You will get a pop-up that says "No triggers set up. Click here to add one now." Go ahead and click to set up a trigger.</p>
<p>There are two possible ways to set up your trigger...</p>
<ul>
<li>Run ChangeIt, From spreadsheet, On form submit</li>
<li>Run ChangeIt, Time-driven, Minutes time, Every minute</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like, you can even click <strong>Add a new trigger</strong> and use both of those triggers.<br />

<p>Save your current project's triggers. You will next need to authorize the app. The pop-up will say, "This app would like to: View and manage your spreadsheets in Google Drive." Click Accept.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-08-08-at-5.00.05-PM-300x202.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-08 at 5.00.05 PM" width="300" height="202" class="float-right size-medium wp-image-4180" />Close your script and go back to your Google Spreadsheet. Click the <strong>Tools</strong> menu and then <strong>Script Manager...</strong> You should see ChangeIt listed here. Press the <strong>Run</strong> button to test it out.</p>
