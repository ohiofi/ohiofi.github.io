<p>Dan Deacon is taking over the smartphones of fans at his live performances to turn them into part of the show.</p>
<p>Fans attending a concert on the experimental artist’s current tour, which is promoting his recent album America, can download the app from the App Store and Google Play before they head to the venue. When the show starts, all phones running the app can be controlled using sonic prompts – in much the same way as the Chirp app we recently covered. The musician can then synchronize the crowd’s phones to display the same color and make the LED lights flash in time with each other as part of the light show. Perhaps most interestingly, the smartphones can also be made to emit sound, becoming an extra instrument for the musician to play.</p>

<p>The app offers a new way for the audience to become a part of the show – increasing engagement – and also exorcizes the stigma attached to fans holding their phone up at a concert.</p>
