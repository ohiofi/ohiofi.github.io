<p>College Hounds (1930) is one of the "Dogville Shorts" comedy parodies by Zion Myers and Jules White. This short is a spoof of college football movies. A man in debt to a loan shark uses his daughter to stop football hero Red Mange from playing in the big game between Airedale College and Spitz University.</p>
