<p>"Our research showed that if we were to make a seven metre tall theremin, that was pumping out that sort of elctro magnetic field, we'd probably microwave people, so that wsnt really practical." Instead, this theremin uses a camera that films peoples movements and responds with programmed sounds, so essentially, you dance around it to manipulate the tone and volume.</p>
