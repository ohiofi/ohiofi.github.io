<p>Course Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendance is required unless excused by the instructor.</li>
<li>Complete all projects and multimedia assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Complete a blog post reflecting on every class meeting.</strong></li>
<li>Video camera, webcam, video-capable digital camera, or video-capable cell phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each week, as part of your attendance/participation points, you will create a blog post that relates to the topic that was discussed in class. You could choose to post about any one of the several different facets of the topic. This week's class was Blogging Platforms. You could post links to a few different educator's blogs and comment on what you like about their blogs. You could consider the implications of having students create their own Kidblogs. You could explain the difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. You could post a link to an article <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRyh4UeP-IY">or a youtube video</a> of someone discussing blogging in education and then write a response to that article or video. These class reflection posts can be written informally, but keep in mind that your posts will be public and your readers may include students, parents, teachers, or maybe even a school district's interview/hiring committee.</p>
