<p id="welcome-newpaper-icon-text">Reader is like a magazine you design</p>
<p>Google Reader helps you find and keep track of interesting stuff on the web. You can subscribe to your favorite websites, and keep up with what's popular. New content comes to your Google Reader when it's posted, so you don't need to visit individual sites.</p>
<p>Plus, Reader keeps track of which items you've read, so you only see unread items when you come back. If there's a border around an item, Reader is marking that item as read.</p>
