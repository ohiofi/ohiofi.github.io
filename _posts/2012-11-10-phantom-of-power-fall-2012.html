<p>My Flash video game, Phantom of Power, has a completely new soundtrack! 17 new 8-bit, chiptune compositions! Click <a href="http://www.ohiofi.com/phantomofpower">here</a> to play! Phantom of Power is a video game that I created so that my MUS-110 Intro to Music Software students could compose 8-bit music for it.</p>
