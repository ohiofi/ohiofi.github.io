<p>On the 48th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Errol Morris explores the story behind the one man seen standing under an open black umbrella at the site. The seven minute short features Josiah Thompson, who wrote the definitive book on the Zapruder film — “Six Seconds in Dallas.”</p>
