<p>When teaching typing, I found it tricky to hold the students' interest. It seemed like a good subject for Gamification/Game-Based Learning. I created the following games in Scratch to allow my students to practice their typing. I left the timer at a mere 15 seconds in order to keep the games quick and light. One student exclaimed, "This game is addicting like Flappy Bird!"</p>
<p>After playing the first game looking at the keys, students played the game with a sheet of paper coving their hands. Students worked in teams of 2, covering each other's hands and writing down each other's scores. At the end of class, we compared scores.</p>
