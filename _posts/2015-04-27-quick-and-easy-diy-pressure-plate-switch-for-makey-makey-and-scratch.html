<p><a href="#">about creating generative art with Scratch</a>. Next, students studied the basic principles of electrical circuits and designed their own game controllers. I plan on posting some of my favorite schematics soon and will post photos/video of the student's game controllers once they're completed.</p>
<p>It took me about 3 minutes to make this DIY pressure plate switch to use with Makey Makey. The hardest part will probably be securing the wires to the sides, but hole punch through a card could be a simple solution. I'm not sure how this will hold up after days/weeks/months of use, but the cards are very resilient.</p>
<p>Below is a video in which I used three DIY pressure plates as drum triggers to make a simple electronic drum set. I used the free program <a href="http://soundplant.org">Soundplant</a> to map audio samples to arrow keys. Soundplant is low latency and works much better than Scratch for audio applications (shown in the last video).</p>
