<p><a href="http://www.ohiofi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pressureplateswitch.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4987 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pressureplateswitch-199x600.png" alt="pressureplateswitch" width="199" height="600" /></a>I have been working on Scratch programming with 3rd through 5th grade. Over the past few months I've posted my <a href="http://www.ohiofi.com/blog/flipped-classroom-scratch-programming-lessons/">Flipped Classroom Scratch Lessons</a> and <a title="Webcam Motion Pixel Art" href="http://www.ohiofi.com/blog/webcam-motion-pixel-art/">about creating generative art with Scratch</a>. Next, students studied the basic principles of electrical circuits and designed their own game controllers. I plan on posting some of my favorite schematics soon and will post photos/video of the student's game controllers once they're completed.</p>
<p>It took me about 3 minutes to make this DIY pressure plate switch to use with Makey Makey. The hardest part will probably be securing the wires to the sides, but hole punch through a card could be a simple solution. I'm not sure how this will hold up after days/weeks/months of use, but the cards are very resilient.</p>
<p>Below is a video in which I used three DIY pressure plates as drum triggers to make a simple electronic drum set. I used the free program <a href="http://soundplant.org">Soundplant</a> to map audio samples to arrow keys. Soundplant is low latency and works much better than Scratch for audio applications (shown in the last video).</p>
