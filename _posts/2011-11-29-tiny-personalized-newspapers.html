You configure Little Printer from your phone, and there's some great content to choose from - it's what Little Printer delivers that makes it really special. We have an incredible group of launch partners, and in the run-up to shipping we're working with them all on custom publications. Underlying Little Printer is our new technology for connecting and controlling wireless products in the home, and we call it BERG Cloud. We think of BERG Cloud as the nervous system for connected products. It's built to run at scale, and could as easily operate the Web-enabled signage of a city block, as the playful home electronics of the future.<br />
