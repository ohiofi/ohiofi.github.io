What are Mad Libs? How do you play Mad Libs? I was surprised to find that only about 5% of my middle school students had played Mad Libs. One student explained that, in Mad Libs, you are given a short story with blanks to fill with nouns, verbs, or whatever. When you read your finished Mad Lib, you (hopefully) get a funny, random story.</p>
<p>As a class, we discussed <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json.asp">JSON</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate">Kate Compton</a>'s <a href="http://www.brightspiral.com/">Tracery</a>. We went to <a href="http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html">the Tracery Tutorial on Crystal Code Palace</a> and began to familiarize ourselves with the JSON/Tracery "rules" (aka <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp">syntax</a>). Like Mad Libs, there was a sentence with blanks (like #color# and #animal#) to be filled with colors, animals, or whatever.<br />
<code>{<br />
"sentence": ["The #color# #animal# of the #natureNoun# is called #name#"]<br />
,	"color": ["orange","blue","white","black","grey","purple","indigo","turquoise"]<br />
,	"animal": ["unicorn","raven","sparrow","scorpion","coyote","eagle","owl","lizard"]<br />
,	"natureNoun": ["ocean","mountain","forest","cloud","river","tree","sky","sea","desert"]<br />
,	"name": ["Arjun","Yuuma","Darcy","Mia","Chiaki","Izzi","Azra","Lina"]<br />
}</code></p>
<p>We took the example above (example 2 from <a href="http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html">Crystal Code Palace</a>) and began to personalize it. We changed the "hashtags" (aka <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">variables</a>) and adapted the "lists" (aka <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">arrays</a>). We ended up with this...<br />
<code>{<br />
"sentence": ["#name#, the #adj# #animal# from #place#"]<br />
,	"adj": ["fluffy","smart","invisible"]<br />
,	"animal": ["unicorn","duck","kitten"]<br />
,	"place": ["the ocean","Cabela's","Ohio"]<br />
,	"name": ["Caleb","Rover","Cartman"]<br />
}</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Cartman, the fluffy duck from Cabela's</li>
<li>Caleb, the invisible duck from Ohio</li>
<li>Rover, the fluffy unicorn from Ohio</li>
<li>Rover, the smart duck from the ocean</li>
<li>Cartman, the fluffy kitten from the ocean</li>
</ul>
<p>The students worked individually creating their own sentences, adjectives, animals, places, and names. After school, I combined all of their JSON values (you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/20hz20khz/BookTitleBot/blob/master/booktitlebot.json">on GitHub</a>), created a <a href="https://twitter.com/booktitlebot">Twitter account</a> for our bot, and then posted the code on <a href="https://twitter.com/v21">George Buckenham</a>'s <a href="http://cheapbotsdonequick.com">Cheap Bots Done Quick</a>. Soon, our Twitterbot was brainstorming book titles.<br />

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tweet2.gif" alt="tweet2" width="300" height="209" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5856" />The next day, we discussed what a "bot" is, what a "Twitterbot" is, and reviewed what our Twitterbot had been tweeting overnight. A few minutes later, the students split into pairs and began working on <a href="#">their own Twitterbots</a>.</p>
