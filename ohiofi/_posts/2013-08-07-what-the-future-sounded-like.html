<p>What the Future Sounded Like is a 2006 documentary about composer Tristram Cary (famed for his work on the Dr Who series), composer Peter Zinovieff, and engineer David Cockerell, who founded Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd. EMS’s studio was one of the most advanced computer-music facilities in the world. EMS’s great legacy is the VCS3, Britain’s first synthesizer and rival of the American Moog. The VCS3 changed the sounds of some of the most popular artists of this period including Brian Eno, Hawkwind and Pink Floyd. Almost thirty years on the VCS3 is still used by modern electronic artists like The Emperor Machine.</p>
