<p>In December 2016, my 7th grade computer class coded game ideas submitted by 3rd graders in Ms. Jones' class. The 3rd grade students had just finished some <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us">Hour of Code</a> activities on <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> and 7th graders had been using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> to program <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntBSwn_8wno">exercise games</a>. For each game idea, the 3rd graders determined their character (Mario, Santa, a gorilla, etc.), a goal (catch 20 bananas, make it thru the obstacle course, win the race), and an obstacle (time limit, Giant Snow Monster, fire balls). Many of the games involved new features that the 7th graders had never used before, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RiOZpyC3Xk">importing GIFs to be used as sprites</a>.</p>
