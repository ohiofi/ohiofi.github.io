<p>This post is the first in a series dedicated to explaining the composition project I have done for the past seven years with my fifth graders. I have had many requests for information about this unit, and it is high time I put it all down in writing. The project has evolved over time, but the end goal has always been for the students to produce a CD of their songs and offer it for sale to other students at our school. After the first year when my PTO provided start-up funds, the project has been financially self-sustaining through the CD sales.</p>
<p>The series includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 - Behind the Scenes Preparation</li>
<li>Part 2 - Theme and Lyrics</li>
<li>Part 3 - Melody Writing and Recording</li>
<li>Part 4 - Working In GarageBand and File Management</li>
<li>Part 5 - Final Production and CD Release</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behind the Scenes Preparation</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Preparation Lessons</h3>
<p>Prior to beginning the composition process, I led the fifth graders in a few lessons on musical styles, common song forms (focusing on the popular verse/chorus/bridge forms), and major and minor tonalities, to get them thinking about how they will approach their compositions. These lessons focused on the music the students listen to - current pop, rock, hip hop, and country hits, as well as some classics and totally random requests. We watch a lot of YouTube videos for these lessons, listening specifically to the styles, forms, and tonalities of the pieces. Throughout these lessons we also talk a little about copyright because it is inevitable that one of the students asks, "Can we just write new lyrics to a song we like?" Well, no, because A.) that's not composing, and B.) you would need permission from the original artist. We talk about getting inspiration from our favorite songs and artists, but that our goal is to create new pieces that represent our own points of view.</p>
<p>Here are some great links I have used in these lessons:</p>

<h3>Organization of Students into Small Groups</h3>
<p>Another essential task that happens before songwriting is organizing the students into their composition groups. I have found that groups of 2 students seem to work best from the students' perspective, but as the facilitator, it is much easier to manage the workload with groups of 3 or 4. Most fifth graders have the skills to effectively collaborate throughout the project, but some groups require additional assistance with their group communication. For the past couple years I have used a Google Form to gather information from the students about their composition groups. I allow the students to request 3 classmates (in order of preference) with whom they would like to work and 1 student with whom they would prefer not to be grouped. While I can't always give each student one of their top three choices, I have never had to put a student with the one person they requested not be in their group. This organizational process gives the students a voice in their grouping for this long-term project, and it allows me to ensure the groups are matched considering abilities, interests, and personalities. It's nice to get other teachers' perspectives, so I always run my group lists past the fifth grade classroom teachers and the art teacher before announcing the assignments to the students.</p>

<h3>Album Title and Cover Art</h3>
<p>Speaking of the art teacher, this year the amazing art teacher at my school, <a href="https://twitter.com/Stevens_Studio" target="_blank">Scott Stevens</a> led the students in brainstorming their album title. He gave me a list of potential titles, and I included those on the Google Form for the students. They chose their first, second, and third favorite titles. I scored their votes to come up with the most popular. This year's CD was called, "What Does Wolfie Say?" (Wolfie is our school mascot, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">"What Does the Fox Say?" by Ylvis</a> was hugely popular at the time.) As the project wound to a close, Scott revisited the selected title and led the fifth graders in creating potential album cover artwork. He and I narrowed down the students' ideas to our favorites, then the students voted on the album cover.</p>

<h3>Learning Standards</h3>
