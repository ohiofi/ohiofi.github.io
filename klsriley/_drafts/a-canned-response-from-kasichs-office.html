<p>Previously I posted <a title="An Open Letter to Gov. John Kasich" href="http://www.klsriley.com/2011/05/28/an-open-letter-to-gov-john-kasich/">a letter I wrote to the Governor's office</a> in response to his call for teacher input as to how Ohio should reform teacher evaluation and implement merit pay. Today I got a form letter from his office regarding his next steps. I thought you all should get to read it too.</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know, a couple of months ago I asked Ohio’s teachers for their help in building a better system for rewarding educators for the difficult and important work they do.  You’re getting this e-mail today because you were one of more than 1,200 people who joined in this process and shared with me an idea, suggestion or concern.  Thank you for taking the time to do that and helping to shape this important effort.</p>
<p>As part of this process, I tasked my staff and Ohio’s Teacher Liaison, Sarah Dove, a 4th grade teacher from the Gahanna-Jefferson school district, to collect information, conduct listening roundtables across the state, and learn more directly from teachers about how to create a system of teacher evaluation and compensation that enhances our ability to increase achievement among Ohio’s students.</p>
<p>More recently, this week I had the opportunity to sit down myself with a small group of teachers who sent me e-mails and showed interest in getting involved in the process to determine how teacher evaluations will be shaped in Ohio. I learned a lot. For example, there are some great school districts that have already created innovative systems of teacher evaluation that work for both educators and the kids we all want to help succeed.  Additionally, I learned just how very important it is to communicate our intention to assess teachers by using a wide variety of measures. One idea that particularly interested me provided teachers a choice as to which measures best evaluate their abilities as an educator. These substantive contributions, and yours, will help all involved as we work to develop a more fair and effective system of evaluation.</p>
<p>The Ohio Department of Education has created a website that includes information about the benefits of teacher evaluation, a blog from Ohio’s Teacher Liaison that will keep you up to date on our progress and, most importantly, a link where you can continue to submit your ideas and encourage your fellow teachers to get involved in the process. You can visit that website by clicking here: <a href="http://teachers.ohio.gov">http://teachers.ohio.gov</a></p>
<p>As we work toward creating a manageable system for evaluating, rewarding and encouraging teachers, I feel it’s important that you recognize my firm belief in developing an evaluation process fair to educators and best for those we all are here to help – our children.</p>
<p>Please continue to stay involved, encourage your colleagues to participate by submitting their own ideas, and together, we can continue our work to make Ohio great again.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John R. Kasich</p>
<p>Governor of Ohio</p></blockquote>
