<h2>Melody Writing and Recording</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Melody Composition Process</h3>
<p>Plan sheet and familiar instruments (barred percussion and recorders, some piano kids), previously used Sibelius to input then listen and revise, started playing directly into GarageBand with a MIDI USB keyboard in the final year of the project (more streamlined and just as easy to edit and visualize).</p>
