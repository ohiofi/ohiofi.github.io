<p>I was tagged in a PLN (Professional Learning Network) blogging challenge way back in December by my Twitter pal and fellow music educator Kevin Dengel (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevindengel" target="_blank">@kevindengel</a>). I told him I'm barely able to keep up with the normal blogging demands of posting, editing video and photos, and the like... So nearly 8 months later, here it is!</p>
<p><strong>The assignment:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledge the nominating blogger.</li>
<li>Share 11 random facts about yourself.</li>
<li>Answer 11 questions the nominating blogger has created for you.</li>
<li>List 11 bloggers.</li>
<li>Post 11 questions for the bloggers you nominate and let the bloggers know they have been nominated. Don’t nominate a blogger who has nominated you.</li>
<li>Post back here (in the comment section) with a link to your finished assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My 11 Random Facts:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>My husband got the initial inspiration for our daughter's name, Cordelia from the name of a pioneer of electronic music, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Derbyshire" target="_blank">Delia Derbyshire</a>.</li>
<li>By my fifth year of teaching, I had taught in six schools in three districts.</li>
<li>I met my husband in 2000, traded phone numbers with him in 2002, got engaged in 2006, and was married in 2007, all within a 100-yard radius.</li>
<li>Because I started college at age 17, I could not get a public library card without a parent's permission, even though I lived on campus.</li>
<li>I wish I could live in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, complete with period furniture, decor, and wardrobe.</li>
<li>Sometimes I tell people I became a teacher because I love office supplies and bossing people around.</li>
<li>I am a huge fan of board games and card games. A couple of my current favorites are <a href="http://www.rprod.com/?page=description-22" target="_blank">7 Wonders</a> and <a href="http://mayfairgames.com/game.php?id=86" target="_blank">Pillars of the Earth</a>.</li>
<li>I learned to play euchre from 7-year-olds at the YMCA day camp where I worked during my summers off from college. And I'm pretty good.</li>
<li>My sister and I got stranded in Laramie, Wyoming with a broken down car when we were moving her from Columbus, Ohio to San Mateo, California in 2007. There is NOTHING to do in Laramie, Wyoming without a car.</li>
<li>I am a wealth of useless knowledge, probably not quite good enough for Jeopardy, but I would clean up on Cash Cab.</li>
<li>My dream "job" would be perpetual graduate student (I currently have a B.M., M.A., and four areas of teaching licensure). I think my next area of study might be architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answers to Kevin's 11 Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What (or who) made you decide to be an educator? <strong>I was good at music, and I enjoyed working with kids, so it just kind of happened. I explored quite a few career paths before making a decision, and it ultimately came down to the scholarship money I was offered to attend Conservatory.</strong></li>
<li>Who is the most intelligent person you know? <strong>My husband.</strong></li>
<li>Have you watched the entirety of the music video "What does the Fox Say?" <strong>Um, only a bazillion times. I introduced Cordelia's daycare teachers to it, and they're very grateful.</strong></li>
<li>If you were a giant mega monster what city would you rampage? <strong>San Francisco.</strong></li>
<li>What was your first mobile phone? <strong>I have no idea, but I've had the same mobile phone number since 2000!</strong></li>
<li>What potential talents do you think you might have if you worked at them? <strong>I think I could have been a dancer if I had gotten an early start. I enjoy writing and would love to write a book someday.</strong></li>
<li>What do you consider is the most important appliance in a house? <strong>At this point in my life, I will say the washing machine, because we use cloth diapers and babies make a lot of messes - and not just in the diapers. In a couple of years, I might have a different answer, though.</strong></li>
<li>What song sums you up? <strong>WOW. Hard question. I'm going to go with "Sweet Besty From Pike" because A) <strong>I identify with Betsy's determination, </strong>B) it's a folk song, which is kind of an important thing in my line of work, C) I'm a pushover for songs in triple meter, and D) <strong>I have loved that song since I was little.</strong></strong></li>
<li>Name your favorite Great Lake. Come on, everyone's got one... <strong>Lake Erie, mostly because I love Cedar Point so much.</strong></li>
<li>Are you a morning person? <strong>Meh.</strong></li>
<li>What would you call your autobiography? <strong>Practically Perfect in Every Way. (That's supposed to be sarcastic. A little.)</strong></li>
