<p>I grew up in a town called Hebron that is about 45 minutes east of Hilliard. My parents still live there. My dad is retired from being a UPS driver, and my mom is a published author. I always wanted to be a teacher when I was little. I also really wanted to be a singer and an actress and a doctor and a lot of other things. When I was in about fifth grade I realized I was pretty good at music. My favorite class in high school was called Music Theory. I went to college at Capital University in Bexley, Ohio. It took me 4 years to get my degree in Music Education. When I was in college, I sang in the Chapel Choir, and we got to go on a big trip to sing somewhere different every year. I was an elementary music teacher for 11 years and a technology teacher for 2 years before getting my current job working with gifted teachers and new teachers across the district. You might think that teachers already went to school for a long, long time and don't have to be students anymore. Well, I decided to go back to college...three more times! I completed a Master's degree in Teaching and Learning at OSU in 2009, I finished taking classes that allowed me to get a school principal's license in 2012, and now I am taking online classes through Arizona State University to learn about gifted education. I love to learn and go to school almost as much as I love being a teacher. I live in the Hilliard City School District with my husband, Justin, our daughter, Cordelia, and our miniature schnauzer, Benny. In my spare time I like to do fun things with my family, read novels, crochet, and sing. Some of my favorite things are:</p>
