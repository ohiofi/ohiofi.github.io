<p>Here are this year's second grade compositions! To read about the process and download the planning worksheet and SMART Notebook file, please read <a title="Composing with Second Graders" href="http://www.klsriley.com/2012/09/19/composing-with-second-graders/" target="_blank">this previous post</a>. After printing a copy of their own composition for each child, and rather than using even more colored toner to create a bulletin board, I decided to put all of the compositions online this year! Click on an image to view it larger and to scroll through each class gallery.</p>
