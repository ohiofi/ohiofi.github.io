<p>In music classes, I have been telling my students about two upcoming musical television events/programs that may be of interest to them and their families. Below is some additional information about <em>The Sound of Music Live!</em> and the return of <em>The Sing-Off</em> for a fourth season.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/sound-of-music/?par=Sound%20of%20Music|Video|Sub%20Nav|Main|null|1" target="_blank"><em>The Sound of Music Live!</em></a> starring Carrie Underwood as Maria will air at 8PM on Thursday, December 5 on NBC. Many Washington students have seen the original film version of <em>The Sound of Music</em> during music classes in past years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/sing-off/" target="_blank"><em>The Sing-Off</em></a> is my favorite singing competition on TV because it showcases a TON of true singing talent. All of the singing groups perform a cappella arrangements of popular songs. No instruments! The judges are extremely knowledgeable about music and about a cappella performance. I learn something new each time I watch. Season 4 premieres at 9PM on Monday, December 9 on NBC. Here are two videos of last season's winning group, Pentatonix. The first video is their first performance during season 3 of <em>The Sing-Off</em>, and the second video is their official music video of <em>The Little Drummer Boy</em>.</p>

<p>I hope that your family considers adding one or both of these television events to your viewing schedule.</p>
