<p>Last year's fourth graders created their own choreography to some of the dances from Act II of Tchaikovsky's <em>The Nutcracker</em> ballet. We used and/or created listening maps of the dances first, paying close attention to the forms of each piece. (Download the SMART Notebook file <a href="https://www.box.com/s/rmtcd0jarmb9vj53mh5z" target="_blank">here</a>.) As the students shared their movement ideas, I served as a facilitator and occasionally an editor. I was especially impressed with Mrs. Stephens's class. They chose the <em>Spanish Dance</em> which has a very distinctive castanet part. I pulled up a video of a flamenco dancer demonstrating castanet technique. This inspired the kids to request more flamenco videos, and they used some of the steps from those videos in their own choreography. While the <em>Spanish Dance</em> might not be the most exciting of the three classes, it is certainly the most authentic and inspired. Watch all three videos below!</p>
