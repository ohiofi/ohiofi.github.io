<p>A couple of years ago I spent a ton of time creating a box full of rhythm dice games for my kids to use to review note names and durations. I wanted them to be easy to use and durable so that they could be used as a part of my own lessons or if I had a substitute with no music experience. The time spent creating the games was well worth it, and the kids have played the games over and over. A couple of the games are from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Music-Games-Grades/dp/156822673X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360028299&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=music+games" target="_blank"><em>The Big Book of Music Games</em></a>, but I created my own boards. One of the games (Rhythm Ladder) was invented by some of my students! Below is a video of some of my fourth grade students demonstrating the three different games.</p>

<p>Here are the printable game boards and instructions.</p>

<p>I laminated everything but the play money bills, and so far they have been super durable. I did purchase some of the supplies for the baggies, but the cost was minimal. I got all of my supplies from United Art and Education because they have a store close to my school and I had coupons. I bought enough to make 15 baggies (for a class of 30 students), with a few extras of each item. When I was ready to assemble all of the baggies, I had one of my classes do it, assembly line style (free labor!). Here are Amazon links to the supplies I purchased for my baggies.</p>
