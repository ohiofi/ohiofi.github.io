<p>I recently presented at the <a href="http://www.ti-me.org/" target="_blank">TI:ME</a> National Conference (concurrent with Ohio's <a href="https://www.omea-ohio2.org/Default.html" target="_blank">OMEA</a> state music educator's conference) in Cincinnati, Ohio on using a SMART Board in elementary general music. The session provided an overview of the SMART Notebook collaborative learning software that runs on SMART Boards. You can view my presentation in 5 parts below (I apologize for the very quiet audio). In addition, the <a href="http://www.box.com/s/pch1bmp8g2emc0cro421" target="_blank">Notebook file I used in the presentation</a> and some of my other SMART Board files can be downloaded <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/9h4xktbb5q">here</a>.</p>
<p>Part 1: How the SMART Board works, layout of the Notebook software, using the Sidebar (page sorter, gallery, links, properties tabs), using the toolbar's familiar buttons, the insert table tool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 2: Some toolbar buttons unique to Notebook, manipulating and animating objects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 3: Screen capture tool, cloning and infinite cloner, attaching links and files to objects, using Flash games from the gallery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 4: More on Flash games, erase to reveal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 5: Scan in old favorites (worksheets, transparencies, book pages, etc.) to use in a more interactive way, grouping pages in Notebook, customizing the gallery.</p>

<p>SMART Notebook and the other SMART software can be <a href="http://smarttech.com/us/Support/Browse+Support/Download+Software" target="_blank">downloaded for free from SMART Technologies</a>. You get a 30-day free trial, then you must enter a product key (which can be found on the back of a SMART Board) to continue to use the software. If you have a SMART Board in your school, you can enter that product key so that you can create and edit your lessons at home. SMART also has an amazing compilation of pre-created lessons using their SMART suite of software. Here is a search for <a href="http://exchange.smarttech.com/search.html?sbj=mu" target="_blank">"music" resources</a> from the <a href="http://exchange.smarttech.com/index.html#tab=0" target="_blank">SMART Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>If you are new to using an interactive whiteboard (IWB), there are lots of great resources on the web with suggestions and pre-created lesson files. Katie Wardrobe's Midnight Music site has a great <a href="http://midnightmusic.com.au/index.php/2011/02/10-excellent-ways-to-use-an-interactive-whiteboard-in-your-music-classroom/" target="_blank">list of ideas</a> for integrating an IWB into your music curriculum. The <a href="http://mustech.pbworks.com/w/page/21952707/FrontPage" target="_blank">Mustech Wiki</a> also has a slew of downloads for SMART Board (the <em>Peter and the Wolf </em>lesson is my personal favorite), Promethean, and even PowerPoint. Whether you're an expert or a novice, these downloads are a great resource to use to create IWB lessons tailored to your teaching needs. And of course, never underestimate the power of a good <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> search.</p>
