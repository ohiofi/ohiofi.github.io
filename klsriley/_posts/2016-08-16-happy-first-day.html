<p>After a long absence from blogging, I'm back! I've been putting it off and putting it off, but this year, I need to get back to reflecting and sharing in this public forum. I have recently started a new position as the Coordinator of Gifted Services and Resident Educators for my district. There is so much to learn, and I have already been collaborating with lots of new colleagues (my favorite thing ever!).</p>
<p>Half of my job will be working with teachers in their first years in the profession. Tomorrow is the first day of school for the 2016-2017 school year, and it's going to be the very first day <em><strong>ever</strong></em> for some of our teachers. I hope all of our teachers take the time tomorrow to reflect on and enjoy the amazing privilege they have, working with the young people who will be the leaders of the next generation. Here is the email I just sent to the Resident Educators in our district.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello, Resident Educators!</p>
<p>There is <strong>nothing</strong> like the first day of school. Kids are excited to meet their new teachers, wearing their new school clothes, catching up with old friends, and making new friends. Staff members are full of positive energy and do everything they can to make every student feel welcome and find their way to their classrooms, the cafeteria, and buses.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you teach preschool, AP Calculus, or anything in between: you get to make the world more awesome for kids Every. Single. Day. I'll just let everybody's favorite president, Kid President tell you more about that.</p>

<p>Be awesome and have a great <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hcsd1&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HCSD1</a>! :-)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Kelly</p></blockquote>
