<p>At my school we have half-day kindergarten classes, and these students do not typically attend music, art, or PE class. Some kindergartners who need extra help with reading or with English language acquisition stay for an additional half-day of intervention in these areas. These students get 25 minutes of the special area classes every third day. This is technically a "duty" for the special area teachers because we do not assess these students, but we try to provide meaningful experiences for the kids in that short amount of time.</p>
<p>One of the favorite activities for the kindergartners on music days is dancing. We do lots of different creative movement activities with different selections and genres. Each song is known by its dance; for instance, <em>Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy</em> is "the tiptoe song." To give the kids the choice of which songs they want to do, I used to have them just tell me, but then I got SMART (pun intended). I created a SMART Notebook file with an icon for each of our songs that links to the song on Spotify. When it is a child's turn to choose the dance, he or she simply comes up to the SMART Board and taps on the icon that represents their song choice. With Spotify open on the computer, the music starts automatically.</p>
<p>Below is a video of my kindergarten students choosing and dancing to their song selections. Since filming this, I have changed how I use my SMART Board. Instead of having the same image on the computer screen and SMART Board screen, I use the SMART Board as an extension of the computer desktop. This allows me to keep the internet browser and Spotify window open on the desktop, but only the SMART Notebook file shows on the SMART Board. Much better!</p>

<p>You can download the SMART Notebook file <a href="https://www.box.com/s/8ivgo519l1c6vpnjhs51" target="_blank">here</a>. I have included circles covering the different icons. I found that it works best for me to limit the number of choices at first and to reveal and learn new dances every couple of weeks. I simply delete the circle that had covered the newly learned song and re-save the file for next time. Spotify can be downloaded <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/start/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you can't get Spotify on your school computer, below is the list of songs I use on the SMART Notebook file. You can always attach mp3 files of the songs to the file instead.</p>
