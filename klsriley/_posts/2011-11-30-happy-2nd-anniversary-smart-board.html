<p>I just realized that today is the second anniversary of the SMART Board installation in the music room at Washington! Here is the photo I took of it exactly two years ago when I walked in the morning after Thanksgiving break to find it installed. (I took this picture with my phone that day, and immediately posted it to Facebook in my excitement.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-673" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="Photo_113009_001" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Photo_113009_001-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am so grateful to the <a href="http://www.hilliardeducationfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Hilliard Education Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.hilliardschools.org/wsh/page.cfm/pto" target="_blank">Washington Elementary PTO</a> for funding this amazing interactive tool that gets used every day in my music classes. This Board is a SMART Board 680 with UF55 Integrated Projector on a SMART Height Adjustable Wall Mount. The adjustable mount is absolutely essential in my classroom so that all of my students, from the teeny little kindergartners to the taller-than-me fifth graders, can operate it comfortably and safely. The documents I submitted as a part of my grant proposal can be downloaded <a href="http://www.box.com/s/ttqr76m5p0ogiht46rgt" target="_blank">here</a>, and I would be happy to offer any assistance I can to those seeking similar grants.</p>
