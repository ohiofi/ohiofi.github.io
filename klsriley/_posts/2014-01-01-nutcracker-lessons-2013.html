<p>Every year in December, I teach themes from Tchaikovsky's ballet, <em>The Nutcracker</em> to grades 1-4. This year I used some <a title="Nutcracker Lessons for Elementary Music" href="http://www.klsriley.com/2012/01/28/nutcracker-lessons-for-elementary-music/" target="_blank">old ideas</a> and added a couple of new ones as well.</p>
<p>Here is Mrs. Tackett's third grade class performing their original choreography to "Trepak" at our all-school holiday sing-along on the last day before winter break. For more information about this lesson, click <a title="Using Student Choreography to Teach Form" href="http://www.klsriley.com/2012/08/31/using-student-choreography-to-teach-form/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://twitter.com/PFPiedPiper/status/408580562941919232/photo/1" target="_blank">great post</a> by a music teacher I follow on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/PFPiedPiper" target="_blank">@PFPiedPiper</a>), I found a great cup game for "Trepak" that I tried with the fourth grade classes. Two of the three classes really enjoyed it and decided to create their own cup games to the "March" from <em>The Nutcracker</em>. Mrs. Triplett's class's cup routine was very intricate. Mrs. John's class's was a little simpler, if any music teachers out there are interested in trying it with their classes. Both classes' videos are below.</p>

<p>The other fourth grade class, Mrs. Stephens's class, was not keen on the idea of making up a cup game. I'm not sure why not, but in the interest of giving the students' choice and voice, I gave them 5 minutes to convince me to do something different. One student, Christian had the idea to make up a flashlight dance. I was instantly sold! Luckily, so were the kids. My uber-supportive principal even let me use school funds to buy a class set of matching (working) flashlights. Here is their performance of "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" from the sing-along.</p>
