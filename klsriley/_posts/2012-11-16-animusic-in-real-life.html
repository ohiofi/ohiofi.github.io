<p>One of the most requested DVDs in my classroom is <em>Animusic</em>. If you are not familiar with the <em>Animusic</em> DVDs (there are currently two, with a third in development), you MUST check them out. The DVDs feature musical compositions and computer animations in which theoretical instruments play themselves. It is a very cool visualization of music making that easily grabs kids' attention and imaginations. Animusic even has <a href="http://www.animusic.com/education/index.php" target="_blank">teacher guides</a> for their two DVDs available on their <a href="http://www.animusic.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>One of my personal favorite pieces is called "Pipe Dream" and the awesome folks at Animusic, LLC have uploaded it to YouTube for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>It turns out, my students and I are not the only ones who love "Pipe Dream." Some really smart people at Intel created a real life "Pipe Dream" that you can watch in the video belowÂ and compare to the original animated version.</p>
