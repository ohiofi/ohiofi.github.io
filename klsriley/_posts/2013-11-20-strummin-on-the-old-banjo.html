<p>Third graders recently learned the rhythm "tika-tika," also known as four sixteenth notes. One of the songs I use to teach this rhythmic concept is "Dinah."</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1457" align="aligncenter" width="490"]<img class=" wp-image-1457     " alt="The traditional folk song, &quot;Dinah&quot; arranged for recorder." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/GABD-Dinah.png" width="490" height="132" /> The traditional folk song, "Dinah" arranged for recorder.[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After singing this song and dictating the rhythm, one of the students asked, "What's a banjo?" It hadn't occurred to me that they might not know this! So I did what any 21st century music educator would do - I went to YouTube and pulled up the first song I could think of that featured a banjo.</p>

<p>Another one of the students in the same third grade class opened my eyes to some really amazing news... There is a picture book rendition of Steve Martin's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Late-School-Steve-Martin/dp/B0055X51FQ/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385001821&amp;sr=1-10" target="_blank"><em>Late for School</em></a>!! The illustrator, C.F. Payne has illustrated one of my other favorite music picture books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Remarkable-Farkle-McBride-John-Lithgow/dp/0689835418/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385000103&amp;sr=1-4" target="_blank"><em>The Remarkable Farkle McBride</em></a> by John Lithgow.</p>
<p>For future lessons, I am planning to pair these two picture books to hit on two of the <a href="http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Academic-Content-Standards/Fine-Arts/2012-Revised-Fine-Arts-Standards/Music_Learning_Standards-1.pdf.aspx" target="_blank">Ohio Music Standards</a> for third grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>1CE Visually and aurally, identify the four families of orchestral instruments.</li>
<li>6CE Identify careers in music including composing, performing and conducting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Remarkable Farkle McBride</em> is a great story about the orchestra (1CE). Authors Steve Martin and John Lithgow are both accomplished musicians (6CE) but are more famous for their acting careers. This would be a very interesting conversation to have with the students about how music is related to the other performing arts and to fine arts such as illustration.</p>
<p>I love it when a simple question from a student leads me down a teaching path I never would have expected!</p>
