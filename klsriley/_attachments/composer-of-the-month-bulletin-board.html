excerpt: Composer of the Month Bulletin Board
---
<p>This is the third year I have done "Composer of the Month" units for teaching music history, but only the first year that I have had a bulletin board for it in my classroom. I bought the map at United Art and Education, and I print and laminate my own info about the composer we are studying. I use a piece of ribbon to point to the composer's birthplace (in this case, Tchaikovsky). Each month, when I switch out the info, I put the photo of the previous composer up on my timeline. The kids often use this bulletin board and the timeline as resources during class.</p>
