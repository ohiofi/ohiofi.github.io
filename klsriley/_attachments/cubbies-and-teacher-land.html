excerpt: Cubbies and Teacher Land
---
<p>This is one of my favorite organized areas of my classroom. Each cubby contains a student supply, and is labeled with a little print out that I laminated and attached with a binder ring. The kids know exactly where to get things and - just as important - where to put them away. Before I got a SMART Board, my desk was behind the cubbies. When I moved my desk to the other side of the room, it made sense to leave all of my teacher resources here. One of my best ideas of all time is keeping Band-Aids out for kids to use when they need them. They are in the little box on top of the plastic drawers with the hand sanitizer and tissues.</p>
